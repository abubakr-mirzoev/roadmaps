def learn(theme): skill {
    if quickstart(theme): # understanding theme basic concepts, principles, components (theory: min, practice: max)
        if fundamentals(theme): # laerning theme core aspects (theory: avg (concpect - links, quiz), practice: max)
            newtheme = newtheme(theme)
            if newtheme != None:
                return learn(newtheme)
            return skill
        else:
            return fundamentals(theme)

1. Learning method:
    1. Quick Start (Sources: todo, Theory: low, Practice: high, Conspect: -, Teaching materials: -, Quiz materials: -)
    2. Learn Basic Fundamentals 
    3. Increase level (todo)
2. Feedback: Feedback from experts in the field. Improve and refine your technique.
3. Teach Others: Teaching is a powerful way to solidify your understanding and mastery of a skill. Share your knowledge and mentor others who are on the same journey.
